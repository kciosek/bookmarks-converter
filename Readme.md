# Bookmarks Importer
by Kamil Ciosek

This Chrome plugin reads a html file generated by getpocket.com's export functionality and adds the contents as bookmarks to Chrome. Since Chrome has no functionality for tags, tags are added as part of bookmark name.

How to use:
 - Use getpocket.com to export your webpage database as a html file.
 - Install plugin (the easiest way is to do it in developer mode).
 - Press the plus button.
 - Use the popup to select the html file.
 - The bookmarks whould be added automatically.

This plugin works as of 1 January 2017. There is no guarantee that getpocket.com will keep the file format for their export files - if it changes, the plugin will no longer work.
